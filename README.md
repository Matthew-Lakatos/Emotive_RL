# Emotive_RL: Emotion-Driven Reinforcement Learning with Predictive and Neuromorphic Modulation

## Overview

**Emotive_RL** is a biologically inspired reinforcement learning (RL) framework that simulates emotional cognition to improve learning and adaptability in autonomous agents. Grounded in **Fristonâ€™s Free Energy Principle** and the **Bayesian Brain Hypothesis**, this codebase implements emotion modeling as recursive, predictive belief updates. The emotional states influence action selection via neuromodulatory signals modeled with spiking dynamics, inspired by neurotransmitter activity (dopamine, serotonin).

This project is based on the supplementary study:
**"Predictive Emotion Dynamics and Neuromorphic Mood Embeddings in Reinforcement Learning Agents"**  
Matthew Lakatos (2025)

## Core Concepts

- **Predictive Emotion Coding**: Uses recurrent models (e.g., GRUs) to anticipate future emotional states, minimizing prediction error through time.
- **Neuromorphic Mood Embeddings**: Encodes mood states as dopaminergic/serotonergic analogs that influence the reward signal.
- **Affect-Weighted RL**: Integrates emotional prediction error into the advantage function of PPO, modulating action values.
- **Free Energy Minimization**: Emotions guide agents to minimize uncertainty and "surprise" in complex environments.

## Features

- Emotionally augmented Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Predictive emotion module using GRU-based RNNs
- Neuromodulatory reward shaping
- ROS deployment support for real-world robots
